## Problem:

- Rehabilitation patients face challenges in performing exercises at home due to their complexity, uncertainty about execution, or lack of motivation. This impedes their rehabilitation progress, prolonging the recovery process.
- Physiotherapists remain uninformed about their patients' progress between sessions, leading to a slower pace of improvement and elongated therapy sessions.
- As a result, physiotherapists are unable to accommodate new patients efficiently, exacerbating the bottleneck in the rehabilitation process.

## Solution:
ROMET is a comprehensive solution catering to physiotherapists and patients for conducting remote rehabilitation sessions. Leveraging computer vision technology, the mobile app enables precise tracking of range of motion during various exercises. The web app allows the PT to prescribe exercises and track their patients progress to better provide care to them.

### Web App (for Physiotherapists):
- Create patient goals that include the desired range of motion for them
- Prescribe exercises for the patient to do at home by creating a plan for their rehab process
- Monitor patient progress on a custom dashboard with data including range of motion, completion rates, and ratings for each exercise
- View patient comments regarding each exercise session

ROMET aims to optimize recovery outcomes through improving patient adherence while positively contributing to the efficient allocation of healthcare resources.
